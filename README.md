# Lucid

## What is it?
Lucid is a mod that allows time to pass as you sleep. It does this by preventing the night from being skipped and instead speed up time (tick warps).

## Performance
With "enableChunkManagerWarping = false", set in the config file, the performance impact is negligible. With "enableChunkManagerWarping = true", with a decent PC, you should be able to set your "tickSpeedMultiplier" to ~20 before the server has a fit.

## Known Issues
May break some redstone contraptions (I noticed while testing that a fast redstone clock I had setup stopped shortly after starting to sleep), I'm unsure as to why this is.  
Sky jumps when sleeping.

## Compatibility
May or may not work with sleep-vote type mods/datapacks. Let me know.  

Known not to work with carpet mod due to conflicting mixins

If you know of any other incompatibilities please let me know so I can try work them out.
Also you can try the [lite version](https://github.com/nukeythenuke/lucid/tree/lite)
