# Lucid

## What is it?
Lucid is a mod that allows time to pass as you sleep. It does this by preventing the night from being skipped and instead speed up time (tick warps).

## Performance
As you are ticking the world at x times the normal speed, you are effectivly doing x times the work, disabling some of the features and / or reducing the tick rate multiplier via the config file should help somewhat.

## Known Issues
May break some redstone contraptions (I noticed while testing that a fast redstone clock I had setup stopped shortly after starting to sleep), I'm unsure as to why this is.  
Sky jumps when sleeping.

## Compatibility
May or may not work with sleep-vote type mods/datapacks. Let me know.  
If you know of any incompatibilities please let me know so I can try work them out.
