# Lucid

## What is it?
Lucid is a mod that allows time to pass as you sleep. It does this by preventing the night from being skipped and instead speed up time (tick warps).

## Performance
As you are ticking the world at 10x the normal speed, you are effectivly doing 10x the work, luckily it only has an effect while you sleep so shouldn't be too noticable on singleplayer worlds. It may not be a good idea to use this mod on low end systems.

## Known Issues
May break some redstone contraptions (I noticed while testing that a fast redstone clock I had setup stopped shortly after starting to sleep), I'm unsure as to why this is.  
Sky jumps when sleeping.

## Compatibility
May or may not work with sleep-vote type mods/datapacks. Let me know.  
If you know of any incompatibilities please let me know so I can try work them out.
